# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Supermarket-Dataset

-> Exploratory Data Analysis on Supermarket Sales Dataset using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to extract insights and visualize business patterns.
# 🛒 Supermarket Sales - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-> This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a supermarket sales dataset to uncover meaningful patterns, trends, and business insights using Python.

-> The main objective of this analysis is to understand customer purchasing behavior, sales performance, and revenue patterns across different branches, product categories, and customer segments. By analyzing the data visually and statistically, the project helps transform raw transactional data into actionable insights for business decision-making.

# 🔍 What This Notebook Covers

# 1. Data Understanding & Cleaning

-> Loaded the supermarket dataset into Python

-> Ensured data consistency for accurate analysis

# 2. Descriptive Statistics

-> Analyzed key metrics such as:

-> Total sales

-> Gross income

-> Quantity sold

-> Ratings

-> Used summary statistics to understand overall business performance

# 3. Sales & Revenue Analysis

-> Analyzed total sales across:

-> Different branches

-> Product categories

-> Customer types

-> Identified high-performing product lines and branches contributing most to revenue

# 4. Customer Behavior Analysis

-> Studied purchasing behavior based on:

-> Customer type (Member vs Normal)

-> Gender

-> Compared spending patterns and quantity purchased

# 5. Time-Based Analysis
